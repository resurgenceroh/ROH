# Our currency

Resurgence of Hope is a new type of game that will use tokens to reward players for the time and effort they spend playing.

In ROH players have a real economy. Game developers don't sell game items or replicas, but focus on the players.

Fees from the market go into the Treasury

Developers make money by taking "$RHC" spent by players, and players make money by selling currency to new players/other players

Game resources and items are tokenized, which means they can be sold peer-to-peer to anyone in the marketplace.
