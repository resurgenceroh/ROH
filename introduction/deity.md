Deity puppet is the Resurgence of Hope's NFT, and hero NFT assets are seen as a ticket to Resurgence of Hope.



***\*Formation of deity puppet\**** 

The deity puppet is made of ‘genes’. 

Genes are divided into two types, namely [body type gene] [body parts gene]. 

Body type genes were divided into 3 types, with the proportion of [body type, fat male type] [body type, thin male type] [body type, female type]; Body shape determines the appearance of the deity puppet. [Part genes] are divided into: head genes, body genes, foot genes, hand genes and weapon genes. Part genes determine the body parts of the deity puppet. 

Head, body, feet, hands, and weapons are the five parts of a hero, and the attributes and skills carried on the parts will be reflected in the puppet's attributes and skills.



***\*Acquiring deity puppet\****

Deity puppets can be acquired through "market purchase" and "linking the fire"



## Linking the fire

***\*Explanation of tinder\****

Under the persistent experiment, the prodigy Vader finally found a way to improve the deity puppet; Ouidah put the two avatars together, and through the seed of the World Tree, blended the energy of the two avatars, and the third avatars were born. The avatars combined their abilities according to the first two avatars, which was called spreading fire.

In ROH, an deity puppet can create a new deity puppet by linking fire, and the new deity puppet will inherit some of the power of the previous generation. Each hero has a fixed number of times to link the fire, after reaching the number of times, the deity puppet can not link the fire

Linking fire costs tokens: "$SEED", depending on how many times the hero fires

Heroes cannot link the fire again with their descendants, nor can they link the fire with their next of kin

Resurgence of Hope does not sell directly to players: $SEED



***\*Genetics of linking the fire\****

Each deity puppet has five body parts, and each part corresponds to three genes. Dominant (D), recessive (R1) and minor recessive (R2) genes.

Dominant genes determine which body parts actually exist on the deity puppet. In reproduction, each gene has a chance of being passed on to future generations:

Dominant (D) : 37.5% chance of passing the gene on to offspring.

Recessive (R1) : 9.375% chance of passing the gene on to offspring

Small recessive (R2) : 3.125% chance of passing the gene on to offspring
